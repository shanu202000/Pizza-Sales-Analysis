# Pizza Sales Dashboard Project

## Project Description

This project involves creating an insightful and interactive Power BI dashboard based on a dataset of 40,000 pizza sales records for a client. The objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the sales data to aid decision-making and improve business strategies. The process involves using SQL for data extraction and transformation, followed by the application of various Power BI tools to build the final dashboard.

## Introduction
The project aims to create a Power BI dashboard that visualizes 40,000 pizza sales records. This dashboard helps in identifying sales trends, understanding customer preferences, and optimizing inventory management.

## SQL Data Analysis
Before building the Power BI dashboard, extensive data analysis was performed using SQL. Various SQL commands and functions were used to clean, transform, and analyze the data:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats.
- **Aggregation**: Calculated total sales, average sales per day, and sales by category.
- **Joins**: Merged data from multiple tables to provide a comprehensive view.
- **Subqueries**: Extracted specific insights such as top-selling pizzas and peak sales periods.
- **Window Functions**: Analyzed sales trends over time and ranked pizzas by popularity.

## Power BI Dashboard
The final Power BI dashboard integrates the results of the SQL data analysis and provides interactive visualizations. Key components of the dashboard include:

- **Sales Overview**: Total sales, sales by category, and sales trends over time.
- **Top-Selling Pizzas**: Visual representation of the most popular pizzas.
- **Customer Insights**: Analysis of customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Sales distribution across different regions.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Users can interact with the data to drill down into specific details.
- **Real-time Data Updates**: The dashboard updates automatically with the latest sales data.
- **Customizable Views**: Filters and slicers allow users to customize their view of the data.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Combines SQL data analysis with powerful Power BI visualizations.

## Installation and Setup
